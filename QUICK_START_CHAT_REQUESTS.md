# 🚀 Quick Start - Chat Requests System

## 3-Step Setup

### ⚡ Step 1: Run Database Migration

**Open Supabase SQL Editor and paste this:**

```sql
-- Copy entire contents of this file:
c:\Users\User\thefinalwebapplicationpcx-main\database\fix_tokenization_services_and_chat_requests.sql
```

**OR run directly in terminal:**

```powershell
# Open Supabase SQL Editor in browser, then paste the file contents
```

### ✅ Step 2: Verify It Works

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chat_requests;
```

Should return: `0` (no error = success!)
