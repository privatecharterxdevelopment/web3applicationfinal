# NFT Membership Packages Implementation

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### **1. Payment Package Selection Step (NEW)**
**File:** `src/components/Landingpagenew/TokenizeAssetFlow.jsx`

Added a new step **ONLY for Utility Tokens (UTO)** between the Review step and the Preview step:

#### Step Flow for UTO:
- Step 0: Asset Category Selection
- Step 1: Token Type Selection
- Step 2: Asset Information
- Step 3: Utility Token Configuration
- Step 4: Review & Submit
- **Step 5: Payment Package Selection (NEW)**
- Step 6: Preview

#### Three Package Tiers:

**ü•â STARTER - 100 Member Cards**
- Setup Fee: CHF 2'999 (one-time)
- Monthly: CHF 299
- Revenue Share: CHF 3.50 per NFT sold, 1.9% per booking
- Benefits: Basic smart contract, OpenSea listing, wallet verification, basic dashboard

**ü•à PROFESSIONAL - 500 Member Cards** (MOST POPULAR)
- Setup Fee: CHF 4'999 (one-time)
- Monthly: CHF 499
- Revenue Share: CHF 2.20 per NFT sold, 1.5% per booking
- Benefits: Premium OpenSea, multi-tier system, advanced analytics, priority support

**ü•á ENTERPRISE - 1000+ Member Cards**
- Setup Fee: CHF 7'999 (one-time)
- Monthly: CHF 799
- Revenue Share: CHF 1.50 per NFT sold, 1.2% per booking
- Benefits: Unlimited NFTs, white-label, custom marketplace, API access, 24/7 support

#### Add-ons:
- **Custom NFT Design:** +CHF 199
- **Audited Smart Contract:** +CHF 15'000 ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires manual review

---

### **2. Payment Method Selection**

Users can choose between two payment methods:
- **Stripe Checkout** (Credit Card / Bank Transfer) - Fiat payments
- **CoinGate Checkout** (Crypto payments) - BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC

**Special Logic:**
- If "Audited Smart Contract" add-on is selected ‚Üí Skip payment method selection
- Show blue info box: "Manual Review Required - Our team will contact you"
- User can submit without payment (payment_status = 'manual_review')

---

### **3. Database Schema Updates**

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251020200000_add_payment_package_to_tokenization.sql`

Added 9 new columns to `tokenization_drafts` table:

```sql
membership_package TEXT CHECK (membership_package IN ('starter', 'professional', 'enterprise'))
package_setup_fee DECIMAL(10, 2)
package_monthly_fee DECIMAL(10, 2)
package_custom_design BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
package_audited_contract BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
payment_method TEXT CHECK (payment_method IN ('stripe', 'crypto'))
payment_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (payment_status IN ('pending', 'completed', 'failed', 'manual_review'))
payment_intent_id TEXT -- Stripe payment intent ID
coingate_order_id TEXT -- CoinGate order ID
```

**Indexes:**
- `idx_tokenization_drafts_payment_status`
- `idx_tokenization_drafts_membership_package`

---

### **4. TypeScript Types Updated**

**File:** `src/types/supabase.ts`

Added payment package fields to `tokenization_drafts` table types:
- Row type (lines 59-67)
- Insert type (lines 118-126)
- Update type (lines 177-185)

---

### **5. Service Layer Updates**

**File:** `src/services/tokenizationService.ts`

#### Added:
1. **`calculatePackageFees()` function** (lines 62-68)
   - Returns setup fee and monthly fee based on package tier

2. **Payment package data in `saveDraft()`** (lines 167-182)
   - Saves membership_package, fees, addons
   - Sets payment_status:
     - `'manual_review'` if audited contract selected
     - `'pending'` for normal payment flow

3. **Updated `TokenizationFormData` interface** (lines 52-56)
   - Added `membershipPackage` field
   - Added `packageAddons` object

---

### **6. Form State Management**

**File:** `src/components/Landingpagenew/TokenizeAssetFlow.jsx`

Added new state variables:
```javascript
const [selectedPackage, setSelectedPackage] = useState(null);
const [paymentMethod, setPaymentMethod] = useState(null); // 'stripe' or 'crypto'
const [isProcessingPayment, setIsProcessingPayment] = useState(false);
```

Added to formData:
```javascript
membershipPackage: null,
packageAddons: {
  customDesign: false,
  auditedContract: false
}
```

---

### **7. Validation Logic**

**File:** `src/components/Landingpagenew/TokenizeAssetFlow.jsx` (lines 188-196)

Step 5 validation for UTO:
- Must select a membership package
- Must select payment method OR have audited contract add-on checked
- Allows proceeding without payment method if audited contract is selected

---

### **8. UI Component**

**File:** `src/components/Landingpagenew/TokenizeAssetFlow.jsx` (lines 1488-1774)

#### `renderPaymentPackageSelection()` component includes:
- 3 package cards in responsive grid layout
- "MOST POPULAR" badge on Professional tier
- Pricing display (setup fee + monthly fee)
- Revenue share breakdown
- Feature lists with checkmarks
- Add-ons section with checkboxes
- Payment method selection (Stripe vs Crypto)
- Blue info box for audited contract manual review
- Total calculation with monthly fee preview
- Glassmorphic design matching existing UI

---

## üé® Design Consistency

All components use the existing design system:
- Glassmorphic backgrounds: `bg-white/30 backdrop-blur-xl`
- Border style: `border border-gray-300/50`
- Rounded corners: `rounded-2xl`
- Color scheme: Black for primary actions, gray for secondary
- Icons from `lucide-react`
- Responsive grid layouts
- Hover states and transitions

---

## üîÑ User Flow

### Normal Payment Flow:
1. User fills tokenization form (Steps 0-4)
2. **User selects payment package** (Step 5)
3. User selects payment method (Stripe or Crypto)
4. User continues to preview (Step 6)
5. User signs wallet and submits
6. **Payment processing happens** (Stripe/CoinGate checkout)
7. On payment success ‚Üí `payment_status = 'completed'`
8. Request submitted to admin panel

### Audited Contract Flow:
1. User fills tokenization form (Steps 0-4)
2. **User selects payment package** (Step 5)
3. **User checks "Audited Smart Contract" add-on**
4. Blue info box appears (manual review notice)
5. User continues to preview (Step 6) - NO payment required
6. User signs wallet and submits
7. `payment_status = 'manual_review'`
8. Admin team contacts user to discuss audit and payment
