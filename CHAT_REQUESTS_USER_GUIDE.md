# 👤 Chat Requests - User Guide

## What is Chat Requests?

**Chat Requests** is your personal travel inquiry tracker. Every time you chat with Sphera AI about travel services, your requests are automatically saved so you never lose track of what you asked for.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Chat with Sphera AI
Talk to Sphera about your travel needs:
- "I need a private jet to Monaco for 4 passengers"
- "Show me empty legs to Paris next week"
- "Find helicopters for a Dubai sightseeing tour"

### 2️⃣ Save Your Request
**Two ways requests are saved:**

**Option A: Manual Save**
- After chatting and selecting services
- Click the **"Save Request"** button
- See confirmation: "✅ Request saved! Reference: REQ-123..."

**Option B: Auto-Save (No Results)**
- You search but Sphera finds nothing
- Request is **automatically saved** for team review
- Message: "I've saved your request for our team..."

### 3️⃣ View Your Requests
1. Click **"Chat Requests"** in the left sidebar
2. See all your saved travel inquiries
3. Filter by status, search, or date
4. View full conversation history
