### Verify Tables & Functions

SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'user_profiles'
AND column_name = 'role';
-- Expected: role | text

-- Check admin function exists
SELECT routine_name
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_name = 'is_user_admin';
-- Expected: is_user_admin

-- Check admin view exists
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.views
WHERE table_name = 'admin_platform_stats';
-- Expected: admin_platform_stats
```

- [ ] Role column exists in user_profiles

## 👤 Phase 2: Admin User Setup

### Set Admin Role
```sql
-- Replace with your email
UPDATE user_profiles
SET role = 'admin'
WHERE user_id = (
  SELECT id FROM auth.users
  WHERE email = 'YOUR_EMAIL@DOMAIN.COM'
);
```

- [ ] Updated user_profiles with admin role
- [ ] Query returned: UPDATE 1

### Verify Admin Status
```sql
-- Check your admin status
SELECT
  u.email,
  p.role,
  p.kyc_status
FROM auth.users u
LEFT JOIN user_profiles p ON u.id = p.user_id
WHERE u.email = 'YOUR_EMAIL@DOMAIN.COM';
```

- [ ] Email matches yours

      <LayoutDashboard size={14} />
    </button>
  )}
  ```
- [ ] Admin route added (line ~2890):
  ```javascript
  {!isTransitioning && activeCategory === 'admin-dashboard' && (
    <div className="w-full flex-1 flex flex-col">
      <AdminDashboardEnhanced user={user} />
