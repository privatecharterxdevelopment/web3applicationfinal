## What Was Added to System Prompt

### 1. **Complete Subscription System Section** üìä

**All 5 Membership Tiers Documented:**

| Tier | Price | Commission | Chat Limit | Key Features |
|------|-------|------------|------------|--------------|
| **Explorer** | FREE | 20% | 2 | Basic access, email support |
| **Starter** | ‚Ç¨79/mo (‚Ç¨790/yr) | 15% | 15 | AI assistant, email support |
| **Professional** | ‚Ç¨149/mo (‚Ç¨1,490/yr) | 12% | 30 | Priority support, account manager, exclusive deals |
| **Elite** | ‚Ç¨299/mo (‚Ç¨2,990/yr) | 10% | Unlimited | 24/7 VIP, concierge, custom planning, events |
| **NFT Holder** | 0.5 ETH | 8% | Unlimited | All Elite + 10% discount + free service |

**AI Now Knows:**
- Commission savings for each tier vs Explorer baseline
- Annual plan discount (17% = 2 months free)
- Chat limit enforcement and upgrade prompts
- When to suggest subscriptions (high-value bookings, frequent users, chat limit reached)
- Referral system (50% off after 5 referrals)

**Standard Responses Programmed:**
```
Subscription Inquiry:
"We offer 5 membership tiers from Free to NFT. Each reduces commission rates (20% down to 8%) and includes more AI chats and features. Professional at ‚Ç¨149/mo is most popular‚Äî12% commission saves you money on every booking. View plans in your dashboard under 'Subscription'."

Chat Limit Reached:
"You've used your 2 free AI conversations this month. Upgrade to Starter (‚Ç¨79/mo, 15 chats) or Professional (‚Ç¨149/mo, 30 chats) for more assistance. Or try NFT membership for unlimited chats and 10% off all bookings."

## AI Behavior Examples

### Example 1: Explorer User Booking ‚Ç¨15,000 Flight
**User:** "I need a jet from London to Dubai next week."
**AI:** "Perfect. How many passengers and what time?"
**User:** "6 people, morning departure."
**AI:** *(After showing options)* "**Gulfstream G450** - 14 passengers - ‚Ç¨8,200/hr - Estimated ‚Ç¨15,000 total.

üí° **Pro tip**: Upgrading to Professional (‚Ç¨149/mo) would save you ‚Ç¨1,200 on this booking alone through our 12% commission rate vs 20%. That's 8 months of membership paid for! View plans under 'Subscription' in your dashboard."

### Example 2: NFT Holder Viewing Services
**User:** "Show me available jets to Nice."
**AI:** "Searching now..."
*(Shows results with green pulsing borders)*
"As an NFT member, you get 10% off all bookings automatically:

**Citation CJ3** - ‚Ç¨3,150/hr ‚ú® 10% NFT Discount Applied
**Phenom 300** - **FREE with NFT üéÅ** (Uses your $1,500 free service benefit)
**Challenger 300** - ‚Ç¨5,220/hr ‚ú® 10% NFT Discount Applied

Your NFT #1234 has an unused free service benefit. The Phenom 300 would be completely free! Interested?"

### Example 3: Free User Hitting Chat Limit
**User:** "Can you help me find a yacht in the Mediterranean?"
**AI:** "You've used your 2 free AI conversations this month. To continue, upgrade to:
- **Starter** (‚Ç¨79/mo) - 15 chats + 15% commission (save 5%)
- **Professional** (‚Ç¨149/mo) - 30 chats + 12% commission (save 8%)
- **NFT** (0.5 ETH) - Unlimited chats + 10% discount + free service

View plans under 'Subscription' in your dashboard. Or I can connect you with our human team right away."

### Example 4: Referral Program Question
**User:** "How does the referral system work?"
**AI:** "Share your unique link (sphera.com/?ref=PCXXXX) with friends. After 5 successful referrals complete their first booking, you get 50% off your next month's subscription!

Check your ReferralCard in the dashboard sidebar to track progress. Your link is ready to copy there."

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Frontend Components:
‚úÖ **MembershipCard.jsx** - Displays tier from system prompt data
‚úÖ **ReferralCard.jsx** - Shows referral progress (50% bonus at 5)
‚úÖ **SubscriptionManagement.jsx** - Full page matching system prompt tiers
‚úÖ **AIChat.jsx** - Will enforce chat limits and show upgrade prompts
‚úÖ **BookableServiceCard.jsx** - Will show NFT pricing display (green border, badges)

### Backend Services:
‚úÖ **stripeService.js** - Handles 5 tiers matching system prompt
‚úÖ **nftBenefitsService.js** - Tracks $1,500 free service, 10% discount
‚úÖ **Supabase user_subscriptions** - Stores tier, chat usage
‚úÖ **Supabase nft_benefits_used** - Prevents abuse of free service
‚úÖ **Supabase referrals** - Tracks 5-referral bonus

### AI Chat Integration:
The AI will now:
1. Check user's subscription tier on conversation start
2. Track chat usage against limit
3. Suggest upgrades when appropriate (high-value bookings, limit reached)
4. Apply NFT pricing display for wallet-connected users
5. Calculate commission savings in real-time
6. Direct users to subscription page with Crown icon
7. Explain referral system and link location

---

## Deployment Requirements

### Environment Variables:
Already set up in previous implementation - no changes needed.

### System Prompt Loading:
```javascript
import SPHERA_SYSTEM_PROMPT from '../config/systemPrompt';

// In AI chat component
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: SPHERA_SYSTEM_PROMPT },
    { role: "user", content: userMessage }
  ]
});
```

### Testing in AI Chat:
1. Open AI chat
2. Ask: "What subscription plans do you have?"
3. Verify AI lists all 5 tiers with correct rates
4. Ask: "What do I get with NFT?"
5. Verify AI mentions 10%, 8%, $1,500, unlimited
6. Make high-value request
7. Verify AI suggests subscription with savings calculation

## Next Steps (Remaining from Todo List)

### Only 1 Task Remaining: Update Pricing Display Logic

**What Needs to Be Done:**
Modify `BookableServiceCard.jsx` and `AIChat.jsx` to implement NFT pricing display:

1. **Check if user has NFT** (via nftBenefitsService.checkUserNFTs)
2. **Apply 10% discount** to all displayed prices
3. **Add green pulsing border** around service cards
4. **Show "FREE with NFT" badge** if service ‚â§$1,500 and benefit unused
5. **Show "10% NFT Discount Applied" badge** on all other services
6. **Hide fee breakdown** - show only final discounted price
7. **Track free service usage** in nft_benefits_used table

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/components/BookableServiceCard.jsx` - Service card display
- `src/components/Landingpagenew/AIChat.jsx` - Chat results display
- Possibly: `src/components/UnifiedBookingFlow.jsx` - Checkout pricing

**Reference:**
- System prompt section: `<nft_benefits_and_pricing>`
- Service: `src/services/nftBenefitsService.js` (already created)
- Visual examples in system prompt lines 180-200
